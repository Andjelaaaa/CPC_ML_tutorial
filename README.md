# Normative Modeling Practical CPC 2020
This repository contains written instructions, code, and data used for the (virtual) Normative Modeling Practical at the Computational Psychiatry Course on September 12th, 2020.

We will be running all of our code in Google Colab python notebooks. 
These are essentially Jupyter notebooks run in the cloud. 
Running our analysis using Colab will save us from dealing with python library installation and virtual environment setup. 
It also ensures that we are all working on the same operating system which makes troubleshooting much easier (since there are only 2 instructors and lots of students)! 

If you have never used Google Colab before, you can check out an into notebook with lots of helpful links here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)


We will also be using the Pandas library for a lot of our code. There is a great intro to Pandas Colab notebook here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/intro_to_pandas.ipynb)

The template notebook we will be filling out during this practical can be launched here (you need to be signed in to a Google account in your internet browser, for best results, use Chrome): [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/saigerutherford/CPC_2020/blob/master/tasks/instructions_cpc_machinelearning.ipynb)

If you get stuck and need guidance, there is a filled out answer key notebook here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/saigerutherford/CPC_2020/blob/master/tasks_key/key_cpc_machinelearning.ipynb)
