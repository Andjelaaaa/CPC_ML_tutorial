        "Morten and Ingrid are concerned about the health of their father, Nordan. He recently turned 65 years. A few months ago his speech became a bit disorganized. Recently, he could not remember the name of his two grant children. Together, they visit a neurologist/psychiatrist to conduct a number of \tcognitive tests. However, those tests were inconclusive, while Nordan had a relatively low IQ of 74 points, it could not explain his problems.\n",

        "Recently, the family heard about a new screening technique called normative modeling with which one can place individuals in reference to a population norm on for instance measures such as brain volume. Nordan would like to undertake this procedure to better know what is going on and to potentially find targets for treatment. Therefore, the family booked an appointment with you, the normative modeling specialist. You conduct a brain scan of the hyppocampus. \n",
